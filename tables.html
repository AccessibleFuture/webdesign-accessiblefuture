                    <p>Drawing on his research into the history and literature of craftsmanship or tacit knowledge, and building on pragmatic work in computer-assisted fabrication and physical computing,  <strong>William J. Turkel</strong> will offer concrete and inspiring examples of the ways in which unspoken understandings impact the theoretical and practical dimensions of code.</p>

						<p><strong>Activity</strong>: Brainstorming a working list of areas in which tacit understanding and hands-on journeyman learning experiences make it difficult for scholars and junior developers to engage with the theoretical side of DH code craft.

                    <p> <strong>Stéfan Sinclair</strong> will draw on his scholarly interests in the algorithmic, combinatoric, and playful practices of the OuLiPo literary movement to explicate code written with human interaction in mind. This presentation will address the division that can occur between design and development, even in humanities projects in which design elements take on particular rhetorical or interpretive significance.</p>
					<p><strong>Discussion</strong>: What is unspoken but critical in DH design? What is ill-understood or under-theorized—and what can the community do about that?

                    <p>Digital humanities software developers must cultivate a sophisticated understanding of the structures of textual information, and help articulate the ways in which those structures contribute to or inhibit humanities arguments. <strong>Hugh Cayless</strong> will present approaches to the semantics, structures and representations of texts.</p>
					<p><strong>Activity</strong>: Create a quick-and-dirty intellectual model of a humanities document or book object. What existing theories and text technologies did your work draw on?

                    <p>Little conversation takes place among developers, across digital humanities projects, on decision-making with regard to uniformity or incongruity of data. <strong>Mia Ridge</strong> will discuss the process by which one might decide to support or disregard “edge cases” in cultural heritage metadata, and the manner in which decisions about ambiguous or contradictory information can affect ongoing database design and development.</p>
					<p><strong>Discussion</strong>: Share your own stories. How have you worked to incorporate ambiguity or contradictory evidence in humanities computing projects? When have you decided to elide it, why, and with what impact on the scholarly arguments your tool enabled?
